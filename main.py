Welcome to our Plant Disease Detection System, a cutting-edge solution for identifying plant diseases through the power of image recognition. With our platform, farmers, gardeners, and researchers can easily scan leaf images to quickly diagnose plant diseases, allowing for faster treatment and prevention of further damage.

## How It Works
Our system uses advanced machine learning algorithms to analyze leaf images and detect signs of various plant diseases. Simply upload an image of a plant leaf, and our system will identify any potential issues.

### Key Features
- **Simple and Fast:** Quickly upload an image and receive an analysis within seconds.
- **Wide Range of Diseases:** Detects a variety of common plant diseases, including fungal infections, bacterial infections, and viral diseases.
- **High Accuracy:** Trained on a large dataset of plant leaf images, our system provides accurate results.
- **Recommendations for Treatment:** Along with the diagnosis, receive recommendations on how to treat the detected diseases.

## Get Started
To start using our Plant Disease Detection System, follow these simple steps:
1. **Capture an Image:** Take a clear photo of the affected leaf. Ensure the image is in focus and well-lit.
2. **Upload the Image:** Use our website's upload feature to submit your image for analysis.
3. **Receive Diagnosis:** Within seconds, get a report detailing any detected diseases and suggested treatments.

## Supported Plants and Diseases
Our system currently supports a wide range of plants, including:
- Tomatoes
- Potatoes
- Citrus fruits
- Roses
- And more...

We also detect common diseases such as:
- Powdery mildew
- Black spot
- Leaf rust
- Leaf curl
- And many others...
