## Introduction

This project aims to detect plant diseases using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and image processing techniques. By analyzing images of plant leaves, the model can identify various diseases, assisting farmers and gardeners in taking timely and appropriate actions.

## Features

- Automatic detection of multiple plant diseases.
- Utilizes deep learning (CNN) for high accuracy.
- Simple and intuitive interface for image input.
- Provides diagnostic results in real-time.
- Easy-to-understand visualizations of the results.

## Dataset

The project uses a labeled dataset of plant leaf images, with each image categorized as either healthy or afflicted by a specific disease. The dataset is typically sourced from Kaggle.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package manager)

### Dependencies

Install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Cloning the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/neerajr27/plant-disease-detection.git
cd plant-disease-detection
```

## Usage

1. **Prepare the Dataset:** Ensure that your dataset is structured appropriately and located in the specified directory.

2. **Train the Model:** Run the training script to train the CNN on the dataset.

3. **Evaluate the Model:** After training, evaluate the model using the test set.

4. **Detect Diseases:** Use the trained model to detect diseases in new images.

## Model Architecture

The model is built using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with the following layers:

- Input Layer
- Convolutional Layers
- Pooling Layers
- Fully Connected Layers
- Output Layer

The architecture can be adjusted in the `plant disease detection.ipynb` file.

## Training

## Evaluation

## Results

The results section should include metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and example outputs. Visualizations like loss and accuracy curves over epochs can also be included.
